title: KG-Research-Agent
summary: Built a multi-agent, evidence-grounded research system that ingests scientific PDFs, retrieves context with RAG (ChromaDB + Gemini), extracts structured claims and evidence, and stores them in a Neo4j knowledge graph. Features a Planner → Retriever → Evidence → Answer pipeline with session memory, citation-grounded responses, and end-to-end PDF ingestion, querying, and multi-turn reasoning.
