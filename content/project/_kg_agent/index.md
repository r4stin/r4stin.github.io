title: KG-Research-Agent
summary: Developed an evidence-aware RAG and knowledge graph system for scientific literature using Gemini, ADK, ChromaDB, and Neo4j. The agent extracts claims and evidence from papers, stores them as structured nodes and relations, and answers queries with verifiable, citation-grounded responses. Features include PDF ingestion, LLM-based evidence extraction, KG querying, deduplication, and a complete pytest suite.
