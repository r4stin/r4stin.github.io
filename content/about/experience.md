        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Designed an auto-labeling framework that ensembles UPerNet, OCRNet, and DeepLabV3+ using logit fusion and SDF-weighted integration for consistent semantic segmentation predictions.
        * Refined ambiguous regions and boundries using zero-shot instance segmentation with the foundation model SAM, enabling label-agnostic fusion of semantic and instance outputs.
        * Achieved a 5.8% mIoU improvement over the best individual model while reducing annotation time to âˆ¼ 3 seconds per image, significantly minimizing manual effort.
